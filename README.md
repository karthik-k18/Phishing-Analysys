# Phishing-Analysis
#  Phishing Email Analysis Project

##  Objective

The goal of this project is to **analyze a suspicious email** and **identify indicators of phishing** to raise awareness about social engineering threats. Understanding how to dissect a phishing email is essential for improving cybersecurity practices both personally and professionally.

##  Tools Used

-  Email client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird) or `.eml` / `.txt` email file
-  [MXToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) ‚Äì for examining email headers
-  Manual inspection of:
  - Email body content
  - Links
  - Sender address
  - Header fields

##  Sample Email (Sanitized for Safety)

Below is a sample suspicious email used for the analysis:

Subject: Urgent: Your Account Has Been Locked!
Date: Mon, 10 June 2024 09:32:17 +0000

##  Step-by-Step Analysis

###  Step 1: Check Email Header
Use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) or your email client‚Äôs **"View Raw Header"** feature.

**Indicators:**
- `Return-Path`: does not match official PayPal domain.
- `Received:` IP address traced to a foreign or suspicious hosting provider.
- `Reply-To:` different than `From:` ‚Üí classic phishing trick.

---

###  Step 2: Analyze Sender Address
**From:** `security-update@paypa1.com`  
- The domain is misspelled (`paypa1.com` instead of `paypal.com`)
- The domain is not registered by PayPal ‚Üí indicates spoofing.

---

###  Step 3: Analyze URLs and Links
**Link text:** `Verify Now`  
**Actual URL:** `http://paypa1.com.verify-account-login.in/secure`

- Uses **misleading subdomains** and **typosquatting**
- No **HTTPS encryption**
- Clearly **not a PayPal-owned domain**

 Use tools like:
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com/)

---

###  Step 4: Inspect the Message Content

#### Phishing Indicators in Content:
- Generic greeting: *‚ÄúDear Customer‚Äù* (not personalized)
- Urgent tone and threat: *‚Äúaccount will be permanently suspended‚Äù*
- Grammatical issues: *‚Äúverify within 24 hours‚Äù* (poor language)
- No digital signature (e.g., DKIM, SPF fail in headers)

##  Lessons Learned

- Always verify sender domains and URLs before clicking.
- Legitimate organizations do not ask for personal credentials via email.
- Email headers can reveal a lot about the true source of a message.
- Use browser security plugins or endpoint tools to detect phishing attempts.

---

##  Deliverable

- A clear report documenting the **phishing indicators found** in the sample email.

You may also create a `.pdf` or `.md` version of the report for submission or sharing.
